          "# Web Scraping in Python\n\nWeb scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that make web scraping easy and efficient. In this document, we'll explore the basics of web scraping in Python.\n\n## Libraries for Web Scraping\n\nPython offers several libraries for web scraping, but two of the most popular ones are:\n\n- **Beautiful Soup**: A library that provides tools for web scraping HTML and XML documents. It makes it easy to navigate and manipulate the parse tree.\n\n- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests in Python. It is often used in conjunction with Beautiful Soup to retrieve web pages for scraping.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install these libraries using `pip`:\n\n\n## Basic Web Scraping Workflow\n\nHere's a simplified workflow for web scraping in Python:\n\n1. **Send an HTTP Request**: Use the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request to the URL of the web page you want to scrape.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   url = \"https://example.com\"\n   response = requests.get(url)```\n",
