Check out : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AruCsCuew\n\n![Hi!](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/7b/44/e8/7b44e8a0be6fb1a0c4ce3647f6d43f68.jpg)\n\nIt is aimed towards folks who code and like to have a minimal and distraction free interface to write there notes on.\n\n## Modes\n---\n\n**keeper** has 3 main modes : Editor, Previewer and Split\n\nYou can switch between these three modes, by using the icons on the top-right corner.\n\n1. **Editor** : It's gives you a markdown editor to edit you files.\n\n2. **Previewer** : It let's you see the preview of what you have written.\n\n3. **Split** : It let's you see both **Editor** and **Previewer** at the same time\n\n**We recommend using the Editor or the Previewer mode at the moment, since the split screen mode slows down as you type more text**\n\n## Features\n---\n\n- On the bottom right there is a **Text To Speech** button, which reads your notes out loud!!\n\n- On the bottom left there are two buttons **Export** and **Import** which as the name suggests let you export and import your notes. (The Notes are exported in .json format)\n\n- Beside the name of every file on the side panel there is a three dot menu that let's you rename or delete your files\n\n- In the Side panel on top there are two icons one is for creating a new file and the other one is for sorting your files in either inc. or dec. date order\n\n## Suggestions\n---\n\n- For writing notes use **Editor**. Since, **Split**  mode slows down as you write more. (Due to the way it's rendered will fix it soon!!)\n\n## Markdown Examples\n---\n\n### **Syntax  Highlight** \n\n```js\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\n```\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n\n```java\nclass HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### **Tables**\n\n| Name      | Company |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Elon Musk      | Tesla       |\n| Mark Zuckerberg   | Meta        |\n| Tim Cook   | Apple        |\n\n### **Strike and Checkbox**\n\n~~Strikethrough~~\n\n* [ ] First Task\n* [x] Second Task\n",
