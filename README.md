## Why We Built Keeper?
**Keeper** is a markdown editor and previewer. Many existing editors were bolted with features, lacking functionalities like text-to-speech and comprehensive code syntax highlighting. This project was inspired by the desire to create a markdown editor that is both minimalist and feature-rich.

## What It Does
**Keeper** is a markdown editor and previewer that brings together the best of both worlds. Here's what it offers:
- **Text-to-Speech:** Transform your written notes into spoken words with ease.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Enjoy syntax highlighting for a wide range of programming languages, making your code snippets more readable.
- **Online Database:** Utilizes MongoDB Atlas to securely store your notes online, ensuring accessibility from anywhere.

## Major Libraries Used
Some major libraries used for making Keeper: [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown), [remark-gfm](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=remark-gfm), and [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting.
